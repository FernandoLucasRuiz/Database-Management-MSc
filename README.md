# Database Management in Bioinformatics

This repository contains the projects and materials for the "Database Management" module of the Master in Bioinformatics program at the University of Murcia. The course addresses the essentials of managing biological and bioinformatics data through advanced database systems.

## Course Overview

The "Database Management" course covers several key topics:

- **Biological Data and Information**: Understanding the unique properties of biological data, its common representation forms, and the need for structured organization based on research needs.
- **Database Systems**: Introduction to the components and functionalities of database systems, with an emphasis on their advantages and disadvantages in bioinformatics.
- **Conceptual Data Schemas**: Development of conceptual models to verify domain knowledge and facilitate communication with domain experts.
- **Logical Data Schemas**: Transition from conceptual models to logical schemes suitable for implementation in computer systems, focusing on relational models prevalent in biological databases.
- **Data Query and Manipulation Languages**: Using languages like SQL to perform complex queries, data aggregation, and management tasks in biological databases.
- **Privilege Management**: Exploring security mechanisms within database systems, including defining user permissions and secure data handling practices.

## Projects

### Conceptual and Logical Database Design project
- **Directory**: `Project Database Design/`
- **Description**: This project involves the creation of a database to store RNASeq results from various experiments. The design process included developing a comprehensive Entity-Relationship Diagram to capture and organize necessary data about experimental samples, sequencing runs, gene expression results, metabolic pathways, and drug interactions affecting gene expression. This ERD was then transformed into a logical schema diagram that serves as a blueprint for database implementation.

### Data Management and Exploitation project
- **Directory**: `Project Data Management and Exploitation/`
- **Description**: This project focuses on the practical application of database management skills in a bioinformatics context. It includes tasks such as constructing and populating databases with biological data, executing complex SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data, and applying data security measures through privilege management.
